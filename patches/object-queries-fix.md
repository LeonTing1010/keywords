# Fix for Object Queries in Keyword Research Tool

## Issue

The KeywordNova tool was encountering an error when processing query recommendations from the language model. When the LLM returned an object instead of a string for a query, Playwright would throw an error:

```
elementHandle.fill: value: expected string, got object
```

This occurred because the `fill` method in Playwright strictly requires string values, but sometimes the LLM response contained complex objects instead of simple strings in the `recommendedQueries` array.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was identified in the `IntentAnalyzer.ts` file, specifically in the `planNextIteration` and `generateQueries` methods. When the LLM generated query recommendations, it sometimes returned objects like:

```javascript
{
  query: "actual query string",
  purpose: "description of query purpose"
}
```

instead of simple strings like:

```javascript
"actual query string"
```

When these object values were passed to the search engine's `fill` method, Playwright threw a type error because it expected a string.

## Fix Implementation

The fix has been implemented in two key methods:

1. `planNextIteration` in `IntentAnalyzer.ts`
2. `generateQueries` in `IntentAnalyzer.ts`

The solution adds robust type checking and conversion code that:

1. Checks if each query is a non-string type
2. For object values, tries to extract string values from common property names:
   - query
   - text
   - value
   - keyword
   - suggestion
   - q
   - term
3. Falls back to JSON.stringify() if no string property is found
4. As a last resort, provides a default query based on the original keyword

This ensures that all queries passed to the search engine are valid strings, preventing the type error in Playwright.

## Testing

The fix has been tested with various LLM responses containing mixed string and object values in the recommended queries, and successfully handles all of these cases.

## Future Considerations

For a more comprehensive solution in the future, consider:

1. Updating the LLM prompt templates to explicitly request string values only
2. Adding schema validation throughout the pipeline to catch type issues earlier
3. Considering a more structured approach to query recommendations that could leverage the additional metadata an object format provides
